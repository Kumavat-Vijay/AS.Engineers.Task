Create two shapes, the first one being a Circle and the second one being a Square. You have to create an input box where users can enter any number and the 'Area of Circle' and 'Area of Square' changes in real-time according to the input provided. For example, if in the input box, I put the value 'x,' the area of Circle and Square should increase or decrease accordingly.
